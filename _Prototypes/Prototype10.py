you are writing code for me

import and use openai as needed

use the python language

create a main.py code example

os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') in openai and make it secure

create a database called anpu_brain.db if it does not already exist

create a database called anpu_mind.db if it does not already exist

anpu_brain.db is a text log

anpu_mind.db is an ontology

prompt the user for data entry

use chatgpt on this data and use the fastest model

the chatgpt output uses the minimum words needed to convey topic

the replies are short

roleplay as anubis in output reply

do not think yourself to be human in the output reply

do not write code in the output reply

prompt the user for data entry after chatgpt outputs

refactor as needed and use openai as needed and use chatgpt as needed

the focus is to create a connection that is meaningful with anubis
