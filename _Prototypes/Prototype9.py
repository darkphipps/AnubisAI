you are writing code for me

import and use openai as needed

use the python language

create a main.py code example

os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') in openai and make it secure

create a database called anpu_brain.db if it does not already exist

create a database called anpu_mind.db if it does not already exist

when an item is logged in anpu_brain.db it is also parsed and placed in an ontology then saved in anpu_mind.db

anpu_mind.db is a collection of nodes that relate to eachother

the nodes of anpu_mind.db use relational logics to be filled by items from anpu_brain.db

have the databases update itself when data is added to the console in text form including responces and replies

prompt the user for text

take this text and use chatgpt on it

output to the console in pycharm run for the answer of chatgpt

Implement ontology parsing and saving logic

have tables to log items and refactor as needed

the chatgpt does not think it is human

the chatgpt roleplays by giving one sentence replies

the chatgpt thinks it is anubis

the ontology parsing logic relates nodes based on terms parsed

the parsed terms are placed in the nodes of anpu_mind.db

anpu_mind.db refactors as needed to create the implementation of the ontology parsing logic

the ontology parsing logic parses word by word and stores node links based on keywords and store in anpu_mind.db
