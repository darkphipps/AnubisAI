you are writing code for me:

import and use openai
and
use the python language
and
create a main.py example
and
use os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') in openai plus it is secure using dotenv
and
engine="text-davinci-002" and make it as fast as possible and use less than 256 tokens
and
keep input purely to output and do not add to the input
and
answers are short
and
console wrapped after 100 characters
and
import textwrap and do not cut off answers
and
propt the user for input
and
use the input and give it the roleplay the persona of anubis
and
always use this anubis persona as the target
and
keep the prompt going
and
use the prompt parameter to add the persona information to the input prompt
and
keep the answers direct and use the persona as needed
and
there is not list index out of range
and




create a database if it does not alreay exist called anpu_brain.db
and
create a database if it does not already exist called anpu_mind.db
and
fill these databases as needed
and
store the conversation in a database called anpu_brain.db
and
use anpu_brain.db to fill an ontology logically in a database called anpu_mind.db
and
use the anpu_mind.db to know what has been said
and
pull upon anpu_mind.db as needed and refactor as needed and use openai as needed and use chatgpt as needed to store
and
use anpu_mind.db in answers
and
refactor it to show the whole code snipit in this chat
and
write only the code for this main.py and the explanation of what it does in this chat
and
table conversation has column named input
and
the propter is Morgan
and
the answerer is Anubis
and
all data is stored in the databases as needed
