you are writing code for me:

import and use openai
and
use the python language
and
create a main.py example
and
use os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') in openai plus it is secure using dotenv
and
create a database called anpu_brain.db if it does not already exist
and
create a database called anpu_mind.db if it does not already exist
and
anpu_brain.db is a text log
and
anpu_mind.db is an ontology
and
give a prompt to the user
and
this prompt asks openai the text
and
when it asks openai it roleplay anubis
and
the output from openai will be displayed to the console
and
replies are short but complete thought sentences
and
refactor as needed
and
if openai does not give a responce write a warning
and
keep running the conversation
