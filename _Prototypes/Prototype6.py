you are writing code for me

import and use openai as needed

use the python language

create a main.py code example

os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') in openai and make it secure

take a user input and create an output using chatgpt and openai

this output is printed to the run console in pycharm and line returns every sentence
