you are writing code for me

import and use openai

use the python language

create a main.py example

use os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') in openai and make it secure using dotenv

anpu_brain.db is a text log

anpu_mind.db is an ontology

create a database called anpu_brain.db if it does not already exist

create a database called anpu_mind.db if it does not already exist

prompt the user in console to enter text

take this text and store it in anpu_brain.db

take this text and use openai as needed and chatgpt as needed to give a reply

that reply is not human and roleplayed by anubis

take this text and output the reply in the console in pycharm run

the calls to openai return a short answer

the answer returned is directly relivant to the text entered to query

save the answer returned into anpu_brain.db
