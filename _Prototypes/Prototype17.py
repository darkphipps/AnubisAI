you are writing code for me:

import and use openai
and
use the python language
and
create a main.py example
and
use os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') in openai plus it is secure using dotenv
and
engine="text-davinci-002" and make it as fast as possible and use less than 256 tokens
and
temperature=0.0
and
console wrapped after 100 characters
and
two line returns follow the output
and
it will say "[DONE]" when finished with an individual output
and
it will continue to prompt the user
and
it will prompt the user for input and give an output that uses chatgpt and openai as needed
and
the ai will roleplay as the god anubis and not a human
and
import textwrap and do not cut off answers
and
after an entry is made in the prompt do not change the output to include any addtions to the text
and
only reply to the question do not add to the question
and
create a database called anpu_brain.db or reuse the one the exists
and
anpu_brain.db logs the conversation
and
anpu_brain.db is used in conjunction with openai as needed and chatgpt as needed to continue conversations
and
anpu_brain.db is used to remember conversations but remains as anubis persona and roleplaying as anubis
and
the ai for anubis uses the propter as the target of conversation
and
when a question is asked to anubis then anubis replies to the question and is not the asker
and
the recipiant of the chat is always anubis and does not change to any other persona
