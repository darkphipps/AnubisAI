create a main.py file

the purpose of this file will print outputs from openai and chatgpt

it uses the version of the chat api that is a playground

it will write a prompt for user entry in python console

my python console is from pycharm

it will then print after the entry an output from the chatgpt openai output

all outputs are stored in a database

the database is called anpubrain.db and will always update itself with data that comes from the input and ouput of openai chatgpt

if the database does not exist then regenerate it and name it the same name and override anything existing

it will create an ontology and linked list and structure as needed

Take the following factors into account

text-davinci-002 is used as the engine

os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') is used to import the key in the code formatting

prompts_and_answers.db is the database used when storing and retrieving anything
