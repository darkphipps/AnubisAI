you are writing code for me

import and use openai as needed

use the python language

create a main.py code example

os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') in openai and make it secure

create two databases or reuse these two databases

the first one is anpu_brain.db and is a storage database

the second one is anpu_mind.db which is an ontological database

ask for input from the user and store it in a variable called userinput

take userinput and store it in anpu_brain.db

use chatgpt and openai to ouput to the pycharm run console a reply to the userinput and store that data in userouput varible

take useroutput and store it in anpu_brain.db
