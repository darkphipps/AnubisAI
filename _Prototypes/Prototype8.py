you are writing code for me

import and use openai as needed

use the python language

create a main.py code example

os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') in openai and make it secure

create or reuse the first database is anpu_brain.db and is a storage database

create or reuse the second database is anpu_mind.db which is an ontological database

prompt the user for entry

take the entry and use chatgpt to generate an answer and openai as needed

print this answer to pycharm console run

roleplay as anubis in chatgpt

use line returns in the output every sentence

store the entry and answer from the chat into anpu_brain.db

refactor and create tables in the databases as necessary

store chat history in anpu_brain.db
