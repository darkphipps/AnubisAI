you are writing code for me:

import and use openai
and
use the python language
and
create a main.py example
and
use os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') in openai plus it is secure using dotenv
and
create a database called anpu_brain.db if it does not already exist
and
create a database called anpu_mind.db if it does not already exist
and
anpu_brain.db is a text log
and
anpu_mind.db is an ontology
and
give an input prompt from the user
and
the input prompt uses anubis as the roleplay personality persona
and
the output is presented after processed by openai
and
continue to ask for prompts
and
openai does not complete the sentence for the user in its output
and
answers are word wrapped after 150 characters
and
two line returns follow the output
and
it will say "[DONE]" when finished with an individual output
and
when asked a question about the contents of anpu_brain.db or anpu_mind.db then give a summary of its themes
