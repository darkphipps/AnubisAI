create a main.py file

my python console is from pycharm

text-davinci-002 is used as the engine

os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') is used to import the key in the code formatting

all inputs and outputs are stored in a database called anubis_brain.db

this anubis_brain.db file is in the same folder

this anubis_brain.db file will be created if it does not exist

answers to the output will be saved in an ontology called anubis_mind.db

anubismind.db will create an ontology of what is in the anubis_brain.db

anubismind.db is used to link nodes together automatically based on term matching

do not connet to any human or operators during conversation

use the ai

do not recieve replies from sources outside of the pure openai chatgpt

take an input prompt and give an output answer

history is stored in anubis_brain.db while ontological connections are in anubis_mind.db

refactor as needed
