you are writing code for me

use the python language

create a main.py code example

use os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')

create an ontology database called anubis_mind.db if it is not created otherwise leave the existing one and build on it

this is considered an ai structure

create a prompt to the user

the prompt will ask for an input

then it will give an output generated by openai as a print

this output is stored in anubis_brain.db

the data stored in anubis_brain.db is read by anubis_mind.db and crates an ontology with nodes for relations

anubis_mind.db is used to make the replies from openai more accurate for future outputs

if a .db file does not exist then create it and refactor it to fit

create a field for responces in the anubis_brain.db

anubis_brain.db holds all conversation inputs and outputs and recalls as needed

output what is returned from flowing the input through the openai in a print

solve this error and refactor it into the code :sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: responses

the input from the prompt will be stored in anubis_brain.db and used to create an answer that is printed

the answer that is printed from openai and any other necessary proccessing will be stored also in anubis_brain.db

always give an output to the input as a print and store it
