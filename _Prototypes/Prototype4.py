you are writing code for me

import and use openai as needed

use the python language

create a main.py code example

os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') in openai and make it secure

use chatgpt to create a chat where the user is prompted

write the result in console and line return every 100 characters

store all of the user prompt text and result text from openai into a database called anubis_brain.db

crate anubis_brain.db if it does not exist or continue using it

openai roleplays as anubis in the chat

create anubis_mind.db if not created yet or continue using it

fill the ontology of anubis_mind.db with relation nodes from anubis_brain.db

fix error: sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: anubis_brain

add data from anubis_brain.db into ontology of anubis_mind.db
